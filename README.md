# Here is a classifier based on deep neural networks (TensorFlow and Keras libraries) that classifies video traffic received from the AWS architecture (received data from a CSV file is trained) created by Terraform, as well as video traffic captured from another device, but locally (received data from a CSV file compared). Also in this repository you can find the NFStream network flow aggregation script, thanks to it that we can take out statistical data on flows from the captured traffic in pcap format and convert the result to a CSV file.
